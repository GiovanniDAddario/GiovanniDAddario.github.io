Hello! Iâ€™m a third year PhD student at the University of Nottingham
working on black holes, modified theories of gravity and gravitational waves. I 
am in the School of Mathematical Sciences, and I am supervised by Prof. Thomas 
P. Sotiriou, Prof. Antonio Padilla, and Assoc. Prof. Paul M. Saffin.

My work focuses on tests of General Relativity using current and future
gravitational wave observations; in particular, I work on tests involving
the "ringdown" phase of a binary black hole merger. By modelling this phase
in alternative theories of gravity, I hope to predict and understand
deviations from the signal expected in General Relativity. I also work on 
the phenomenology of black holes in some alternative theories, namely
black hole scalarisation. Another topic of interest is the use of effective
field theory techniques in the modelling of binary black hole systems.
